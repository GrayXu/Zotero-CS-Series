Zotero won't auto-generate an abbreviation like "OSDI", so this script is for adding such pub abbreviations in `series` based other metadata on in Zotero.

# Usage

1. get your `library_id` and `api_key`(w/ r+w permissions) from Zotero websites
2. backup your library
2. run codes

# Todo

- rules for arXiv
- trans can't be abbreviated like conf?
